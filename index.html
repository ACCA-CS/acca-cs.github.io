					weather system affecting unit movement and combat,
					resource production, and map visibility. This
					feature demands substantial changes in game
					mechanics, including backend logic for weather
					effects and frontend updates for visual
					representation.
				</li>
				<li>
					Advanced Modding Support: Develop a comprehensive
					modding framework allowing players to easily
					create and share mods that can alter game
					mechanics, add new content, and customize UI
					elements. This involves creating a robust API,
					documentation, and possibly a mod management
					interface.
				</li>
				<li>
					Complete Overhaul of the Combat System: Introduce
					a new combat system with more variables (e.g.,
					terrain, morale, weather). This complex challenge
					requires extensive backend modifications to the
					combat engine and frontend updates for displaying
					new combat information.
				</li>
				<li>
					Implement Cultural Influence Mechanics: Introduce
					a system where cities or entire civilizations can
					exert cultural influence over others, potentially
					converting cities to the player's civilization
					over time. This feature involves complex game
					logic for calculating and applying cultural
					influence, UI updates to track influence progress,
					and adjustments to the diplomacy system.
