				>
			</h2>
			<h3>Easy:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Any Custom Status Message: Modify the pre-existing
					status message into a custom message, that would
					contain an emoji as a part of it.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enlarge Font Size Option for Chat: Implement a
					feature that changes the default project font size
					in a chat room for better readability.
				</li>
				<li>
					Customizable Chat Notification Sounds: Adding,
					thus, changing one of the inbuild notification
					sounds to a custom one.
				</li>
				<li>
					Direct Message Read Receipts Toggle: Add an option
					for users to enable or disable read receipts
					specifically for some messages.
				</li>
				<li>
					Theme Color Preview: create a logic where chat’s
					color is set based on chat’s name. i.e. Name is
					Defining the chat color.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Medium:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Advanced Chat Room Filters: Implement advanced
					filtering options for chat rooms, such as
					filtering by activity level, number of
					participants, or custom tags. This requires
					backend logic to sort/filter rooms and frontend
					updates for the UI.
				</li>
				<li>
					User Mute/Unmute Notifications: Extend the
					mute/unmute feature to include optional
					notifications when a user is muted or unmuted in a
					chat room. This involves backend changes to handle
					the notification logic and frontend changes for
					displaying notifications.
				</li>
				<li>
					Customizable Chat Room Layouts: Allow users to
					customize the layout of chat rooms (e.g., where
					the message input box is located, how messages are
					displayed). This requires significant frontend
					changes and possibly backend support for storing
					preferences.
				</li>
				<li>
					Automated Chat Moderation Rules: Allow admins to
					set up automated rules for chat moderation (e.g.,
					auto-mute for specific phrases). This requires
					backend logic for the rules engine and frontend
					changes for rule management.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Hard:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Advanced Analytics Dashboard for Chat Admins:
					Create an advanced analytics dashboard that
					provides detailed insights into chat room metrics
					(e.g., message volume, user engagement, sentiment
					analysis).
				</li>
				<li>
					Language Learning Capabilities based on
					translations: There is a capability for
					translation of messages. But task is to implement
					the capability where user would be able to learn a
					new language, e.g. only partially translate
					messages, where translated text amount is reduced
					over time, likewise, create a mechanics for it.
					(I.e. initially, simple words are not translated,
					and with time more and more of them are not being
					translated, as time goes and number of
					non-translated text increases and, the difficulty
					– word complexity, would also increase, meaning
					more complicated words are not translated are also
					not being translated.)
				</li>
				<li>
					End-to-End Encryption for Private Chats: Allow
					user to upload a custom key, e.g. custom RSA key
					and be able to use it instead for encryption.
				</li>
				<li>
					Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Sharing in Chat Rooms:
					Enable direct file sharing between users within a
					chat room without uploading to the server
				</li>

				<li>
					Enhanced Security for Sensitive Messages:
					Implement a feature to mark message as
					“sensitive”, thus encrypting them in a way that
					only for a given user can read them, while others,
					might see just a scrambled text.
				</li>
				<li>
					Privacy-Enhanced Messaging Mode: mode that would
					hide the message until it is being clicked or
					hovered over, and would be deleted after some set
					time.
				</li>
			</ul>

			</h2>
			<h3>Easy:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Add a New Unit Type: Create a simple new unit
					type, which would be integrated into one of the
					cultures, or be generic for all (e.g., a unique
					scout with slightly altered stats from existing
					units)
				</li>
				<li>
					Modify Unit Cost: Change the resource cost of
					producing a unit.
				</li>
				<li>
					Introduce a New Building Bonus: Add a small bonus
					for an existing building (e.g., an additional
					happiness point for a library)
				</li>
				<li>
					Adjust Technology Research Time: Slightly modify
					the time it takes to research a technology, aiming
					to balance gameplay. This requires changes to the
					technology definitions file.
				</li>
				<li>
					Update Civilization Starting Units: Alter the
					starting units for a civilization, such as giving
					a civilization a unique unit at the start.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Medium:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Custom automation: Game has some automation
					features. Existing features: auto explore, auto
					work. New feature could be, automatic city
					development, or have auto defense/attack when
					enemy unit is discovered.
				</li>
				<li>
					Implement a New Resource Type: Introduce a new
					resource type into the game, including its effects
					on city development or trade. This requires
					updates to the game's resource management system,
					including backend logic for resource effects and
					frontend updates for resource display.
				</li>
				<li>
					New Civilization Attributes: Develop attributes or
					bonuses for existing civilizations, requiring more
					nuanced changes across game logic to implement and
					balance these new attributes properly.
				</li>
				<li>
					Custom Victory Conditions Interface: Create an
					interface allowing players to select from various
					victory conditions before starting a game.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Hard:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Create a simple Map Editor for FreeCiv-web: Create
					a new “Map Editor” option next to “Start Game” and
					“Load Game”, which would allow to do some editing
					to maps.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create a new Civilization: It need to have a
					different technology tree, and various units and
					buildings.
				</li>

				<li>
					Dynamic Weather System: Implement a dynamic
					weather system affecting unit movement and combat,
					resource production, and map visibility. Create
					environmental effects, e.g. rain slows down units,
					ground tiles may reduce some unit parameters, or
					some cultures gain environmental benefits.
				</li>
				<li>
					Advanced Modding Support: Develop a comprehensive
					modding framework allowing players to easily
					create and share mods that can alter game
					mechanics, add new content, and customize UI
					elements. This involves creating a robust API,
					documentation, and possibly a mod management
					interface.
				</li>
				<li>
					Complete Overhaul of the Combat System: Introduce
					a new combat system with more variables (e.g.,
					terrain, morale, weather). This complex challenge
					requires extensive backend modifications to the
					combat engine and frontend updates for displaying
					new combat information.
				</li>
				<li>
					Implement Cultural Influence Mechanics: Introduce
					a system where cities or entire civilizations can
					exert cultural influence over others, potentially
					converting cities to the player's civilization
					over time. This feature involves complex game
					logic for calculating and applying cultural
					influence, UI updates to track influence progress,
					and adjustments to the diplomacy system.
				</li>
			</ul>

					object that is chosen and placed.
				</li>
				<li>
					Increase Text Size in UI: Adjust the default font
					size for all text elements in the UI to enhance
					readability.
				</li>

				<li>
					Set Default Color for All objects: Altering a
					default color variable that is applied to new
					objects. (Even when another object is selected to
					be placed its default initial color need to be
					custom, without user setting it)
				</li>
				<li>
					Increase the icon size: objects that user chooses
					are quite small, so they need to be increased in
					size.
				</li>
				<li>
					Simplify the UI Dashboard: UI has a lot of

					minimalistic by removing some things from it.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Medium:</h3>

				<li>
					Add custom object in the menu (e.g., triangle):
					This involves creating a new menu item and
					possibly adding a new 3D model asset.
				</li>
				<li>
					User Interface for Model Scaling: Create a slider
					interface that allows users to adjust the scale of
					selected 3D models more precisely than pinch
					gestures.
				</li>
				<li>
					Model Transparency Control: Introduce a slider in
					the UI that lets users adjust the opacity of
					selected 3D models.

					between multiple points or objects in 3D space,
					taking into account the perspective and scale of
					the AR environment.
				</li>
				<li>
					Programmable AR Object Behaviors: Allow users to
					define behaviors for objects that can be triggered
					by specific events or conditions, such as an
					object that changes color when another object
					comes close.

					Performance Tuning Settings: Provide advanced
					settings that allow users to optimize performance
					by adjusting the fidelity of textures or the
					complexity of shaders.
